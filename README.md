The Google Play Store Review Analysis EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project is a data analysis project the aims to gain insights and understand patterns from the reviews of apps on the Google Play Store.The project involves conducting exploratory data analysis techniques to analyze a dataset of reviews,extract meaningful information and visualize the findings.

The main objectives of the project may include:


*   **Data Collection**:-Gathering a dataset of reviews from the Google Play Store,which may involve web scraping or accessing a pre-existing  dataset.

*   **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:-Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to remove irrelevant or duplicate information,handle missing values, and convert data into a suitable format for analysis.
 

*   **Exploratory Data Analsis(EDA)**:-Conducting various EDA techniques,such as descriptive statistics,data visualization and data aggregation to gain insights and understand patterns in the data.This may involve analyzing key metrics, such as ratings,review text,app categories and user demographics to identify trends,patterns and correlations.


*   **Sentiment Analysis**:- Performing sentiment analysis on the review text to categorize the reviews as positive,negative, or neutral. This may involve using natural language processing(NLP) techniques,such as text classification or using pre-trained sentiment analysis models.Sentiment analysis can provide insights on the overall user satisfaction and feedback regarding the apps.

*   **Feature Engineering**:-Feature engineering involves creating new features or deriving meaningful insights from existing features in the data.For example,extracting features like review length ,review sentiment and app rating distribution can provide addtitional insights into the reviews data.

*   **Insights and Recommendations**:-Based on the findings from the data analysis,insights and recommendations can be derived to provide actionable recommendations to app developers or businesses. For example,identifying popular features among users,or understanding user preferences can help app developers make informed decisions to improve their app and user experience. 


*   **Visualization and Reporting**:- Creating visualizations,such as bar charts,pie charts, and word clouds,to visually represent the findings from the EDA and sentiment analysis. Generating a summary report to present the key findings,insights and recommendations.
